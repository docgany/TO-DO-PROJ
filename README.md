TO-DO App - A simple CRUD project using html/css/Javascript

A lightweight, beginner‑friendly To‑Do List Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project focuses on understanding the CRUD workflow — Create, Read, Update, Delete — and how to use localStorage to save and retrieve data in the browser.
This app is part of my ongoing journey to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals and build practical, interactive tools for learning and teaching.

* Features
- Add new tasks (Create)
- Display saved tasks (Read)
- Edit existing tasks (Update)
- Delete tasks (Delete)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Clean, simple UI
- Beginner‑friendly code structure

* What I Learned
This project helped reinforce:
- How to structure a small JavaScript project
- How CRUD operations map to real UI interactions
- How to store and retrieve data using localStorage
- How to update the DOM dynamically
- How to break down features into clear, manageable steps
- The importance of clean, readable code for teaching beginners
